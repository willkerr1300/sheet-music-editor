## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Real-Time Collaboration**: Uses **Yjs CRDTs** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to ensure eventual consistency across all connected clients without central locking.
*   **Grand Staff Rendering**: Automatically renders both Treble and Bass staves using **VexFlow**, intelligently routing notes to the correct staff based on pitch.
*   **Optimized Networking**: Implements a custom binary-encoded WebSocket protocol that reduces payload size by **~65%** compared to standard JSON.
*   **High-Performance Rendering**: Features a differential rendering engine that updates only modified measures, maintaining **60 FPS** during active collaboration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
*   **Rendering**: VexFlow (Music Notation), Canvas/SVG
*   **State / Sync**: Yjs (CRDT), y-websocket
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, WebSocket (ws)
